# DDMCS-FinalProject
 
Final project for the course "Data Driven Modeling of Complex Systems", MSc Data Science, Sapienza Universit√† di Roma 2024-25.

In the project I investigate how the behavior of users on Stack Overflow changed since the diffusion of LLMs at the end of 2022. In particular I study how the network of users and questions evolved over time and how the type and the complexity of questions changed.

The project was rated with top marks.
